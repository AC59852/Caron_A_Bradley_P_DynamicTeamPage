	<p id="para">Welcome to Austin and Patrick's team bio page! Here you will gain quite a bit of insight on who we are, where we come from, our hobbies/personal tastes, and more. This paragraph is just to introduce you to all of the elements of the page before clicking on those beautiful buttons down below. So if you just want to get to know us, feel free to click them now! Upon loading the site you will see some interesting features. Our title has an image inside of it, but the image is actually larger than the text, we just masked the text to allow for a bouncing animation to show the entire image on load of each bio! We also have plenty of gorgeous gradients around key points of the page, and the one wrapping the profile image is different from the others! Currently, our homepage displays the image of one Austin Caron. This is because we felt keeping the image of our developer on the main page gave more personality and allows viewers like you to get in touch with who we are. Thanks for reading this paragraph, and get clicking on those buttons!</p>
